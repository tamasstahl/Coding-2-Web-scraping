# Assignment 2

Assigment 2 contains 3 folders, namely Codes, Data and Output.

* Codes folder contains the R script for the webscraping, data cleaning, enrichment and the analysis. The other Rmd file creates the HTML output required for this task.
* Data folder contains the cleaned data table as a result of the webscraping function and cleaning codes, as well as the RDS format.
* Output folder contains the HTML created by the markdown for evaluation.

My task was to find an interesting website and scrape teh content of it. My choce of webpage was: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_games.html, where I got the data for the whole 2019-2020 NBA season. This was an interesting site as due to the pandemic there were some irregularities, that helped me show my webscraping and analytical skills. 

Please find the webscraping function to download the data for for specific season and months. The parameters need to be updated to the like of the user.

I hope the reader finds it useful how I scraped the website and the analysis at the end.
